When you finish, you can work on the AWS ParallelCluster Tutorial in the next portion. This sets up a Beowulf style cluster that automatically scales up to meet your job's requirements. Spack packages can be installed in the shared Lustre filesystem and backed up to S3. When you're done just terminate the cluster.
