### Step 1
First login to the [AWS Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/) using the steps given in [Account Setup](/00-account-setup.md). If you are running this tutorial on your own (not in an AWS run event), you'll need to login to the AWS Management Console at this point. 

### Step 2

First we're taken to the AWS Console homepage. For the sake of this tutorial we're using the **N. Virginia (us-east-1)** region. Confirm that aligns with the region shown in the upper right hand corner.

1. Visit the [CloudFormation Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=us-east-1)
2. Find the Stack that failed to create, It'll be named `aws-cloud9-Sean-Spack-Tutorial...`
3. Click on the **Events** tbab and scroll down to find the `CREATE_FAILED` error. 
![CloudFormation Cloud9 Error](/images/cfn_cloud9_error.png)  
```bash
Your requested instance type (m5.large) is not supported in your requested Availability Zone (us-east-1e). Please retry your request by not specifying an Availability Zone or choosing us-east-1a, us-east-1b, us-east-1c, us-east-1d, us-east-1f. (Service: AmazonEC2; Status Code: 400; Error Code: Unsupported; Request ID: cedce320-3601-4540-9857-2726c1bb6288)
``` 
4. Next go back to Cloud9 and re-try creation. Under the **Network Settings** select one the Availibility Zones listed in the error message, i.e. `us-east-1a, us-east-1b, us-east-1c, us-east-1d, us-east-1f`
